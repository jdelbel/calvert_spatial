#Goal - similarity/dissimilarity cluster analysis 

#How differnt or similar are the three calvert island sites

#Distance metric - Bray-curtis is used for abundance data

#Linkage method - criterion that will determine how observations will be grouped together.

#Figtree (software) allows you to view and edit dendograms - look into this

#Mahara - average linkage Bray-curtis dissimilarity, log10(x+1) transformed

# similarity calculated using similarity indices ranging from 0 to 1. Ordination uses distances (Euclidean). Legendre & Legendre (2012) offers key on how to select appropriate measure for given data. bray-Curtis and Hellinger distances may be better than Euclidean.

# Symmetrical indices (thos which consider double 0s as relevant not useful for ecological data). Asymmetrical similarity indices (ignore double zeros). Two types, qualitative (presence/absence) and quantitative (raw or transformed species abundance). 

#Qualitative (binary) asymmetrical similarity indices. Information about number of species shared by both samples AND number of species occuring in first or second sampe only.

#Quantitative similarity indices. Percentage Similarity and includes Bray-Curtis

#Distance Indices. Similarity indices return highest value when both samples the same. Distance indices opposite. Two types: 1) Those calculated from similarity indices (includes Bray-Curtis) and; 2) Those which have no analogue in similarity indices. Important criterium is whether distance index is metric or not. Metric = minimum distance is 0, distance is always positive, distance between sample 1 and 2 same as 2 and has triangle inequality.

#Bray-Curits/percentage difference. Suitable for community composition data since it is asymmetrical (ignores double 0s) and meaningful upper vlaue equal to 1. Considers absolute species abundances
