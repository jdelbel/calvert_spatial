Bringing in size designations for Skeletonema marinoi and cross checking with my full species list to make sure that the counts and dates are comparable


```{r}
#Load packages
library(tidyverse) #Data wrangling
library(readxl) #Import excel files
library(here) #File structure management
```

```{r}
#Uploading metadata to attaech to skeletoma counts based on hakai_ids.
meta <- read_csv(here("files", "meta_phyto_2021-06-21.csv"))

s_mar <- read_xlsx(here("files", "s_mar_size.xlsx"))
```

```{r}
#Pivoting to tidy format for skeletonema worksheet
s_mar_long <- s_mar %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(CPHY476:ncol(s_mar)),
               names_to = "hakai_id", values_to = "counts")
```

```{r}
#cutting down metadata file to only include pertinent columns
meta <- meta %>% 
  select(date, site_id, hakai_id)
```

```{r}
#joining skeletonema counts with metadata
s_mar_long <- s_mar_long %>% 
  left_join(meta) %>% 
  select(date, site_id, species, counts)
```
```{r}
#Pivoting wider for comparison with my master sheet
s_mar_wide <- s_mar_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, values_from = counts)



```
