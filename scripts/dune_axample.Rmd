This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data("dune")
data("dune.env")
```

```{r}
dune.mds <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", autotransform = FALSE)
```

```{r}
dune.mds
```
```{r}
#displays empty ordination space
plot(dune.mds, type = "n") 

# displays site points where symbols (pch) are different management options and colour (col) are different land uses
points(dune.mds, display = "sites", 
       pch = c(16, 8, 17, 11) [as.numeric(dune.env$Management)], 
       col = c("blue", "orange", "black") [as.numeric(dune.env$Use)]) 

# displays symbol and colour legend
legend("topright", legend = c(levels(dune.env$Management), levels(dune.env$Use)), 
       pch = c(16, 8, 17, 11, 16, 16, 16), 
       col = c("black","black","black","black","blue", "orange", "black"), 
       bty = "n", cex = 1) 

# displays legend text of stress value
legend("topleft", "stress = 0.118", bty = "n", cex = 1)  
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
